# CozmoBot

`ROS` node for the Cozmo and computer vision to detect its cubes. In `python3`.

Using [pycozmo](https://github.com/zayfod/pycozmo/), [ROS noetic](https://www.ros.org) and [OpenCV](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

**_WARNING_** Work in progress. Only basic functions of the Cozmo (moving wheels, head, lift and camera images) are implemented. Cubes are NOT detected.

## A ROS node using PyCozmo ?

See the README.md in `ROS/cozmp`

## Playing with OpenCV

It is in `harriscorner.py` and `feat_matchin.py`. Draft work to play with the concepts.
